                    <h1>Web Server</h1>

                    <p>There is no shortage of web servers in the industry. So why build another one?</p>

                    <p><strong>Because Layer 8 requires absolute coherence and zero external dependency.</strong></p>

                    <p>Traditional web servers are designed around static endpoints, predefined routes, and tight coupling between transport, security, and application logic. They assume APIs are known in advance and wired manually.</p>

                    <p>Layer 8 makes a different assumption.</p>

                    <p>In Layer 8, services are defined by intent, not by endpoints. APIs are discovered, enforced, and exposed dynamically at runtime.</p>

                    <p>The Layer 8 Web Server is therefore not a generic HTTP engine. It is a first-class architectural component.</p>

                    <p>It integrates directly with the Security Provider and the AAA system, allowing services to expose their APIs dynamically, without pre-hardcoded routes, without manual wiring, and without leaking transport concerns into service design.</p>

                    <p>Endpoints are not configured. <strong>They emerge.</strong></p>

                    <p>The web server becomes an execution surface for service contracts, not a place where application logic is embedded.</p>

                    <p>This preserves coherence across the platform, keeps services decoupled from transport mechanics, and ensures that security, identity, and authorization are enforced consistently&mdash;by design, not by convention.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>What the Web Server No Longer Owns</h2>

                    <p>In Layer 8, the Web Server is intentionally constrained.</p>

                    <p>It does not own responsibilities that traditionally accumulate inside web frameworks and HTTP gateways.</p>

                    <p>Specifically, the Web Server no longer owns:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Routing logic</li>
                        <li>Application behavior</li>
                        <li>API design decisions</li>
                        <li>Model semantics</li>
                        <li>Security policy</li>
                        <li>Session state and concurrency ownership</li>
                        <li>Startup ordering and dependency coordination</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>By removing these responsibilities, the Web Server is reduced to what it must be:<br>
                    <strong>an execution surface for declared contracts.</strong></p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>Statelessness and Scaling</h2>

                    <p>Because the Web Server owns no application state, no session context, and no service guarantees, <strong>it is stateless by design.</strong></p>

                    <p>All stateful behavior, identity, session continuity, concurrency enforcement, and lifecycle guarantees; is owned by the <strong>Security Provider</strong> and the service runtime, as declared in the <strong>Service SLA</strong>.</p>

                    <p>As a result, scaling the Web Server is purely mechanical. Instances can be added or removed at any time without coordination, rebalancing, or warm-up logic.</p>

                    <p>High availability is achieved through replication, not configuration. Every Web Server instance is interchangeable, because nothing inside it needs to be remembered.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>Web API in the SLA</h2>

                    <p>In Chapter 10, the Service SLA was introduced as the contract that defines behavior, concurrency, and guarantees.</p>

                    <p>One aspect was intentionally deferred: how a service exposes its capabilities to the outside world through a Web API.</p>

                    <p>In Layer 8, a service's internal API and its external Web API are not the same thing.</p>

                    <p>There is no one-to-one mapping between them.</p>

                    <p>For that reason, each Service SLA includes a dedicated section that declares the Web APIs the service exposes.</p>

                    <p>Each Web API entry defines:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>the input model</li>
                        <li>the HTTP method</li>
                        <li>the response model</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>An entry represents an externally visible contract, not an implementation detail.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>UI Concerns vs Service Guarantees</h2>

                    <p>A Web API is a delivery mechanism, not the source of guarantees.</p>

                    <p>UI and transport concerns include request formatting, timeouts, retries, pagination, caching, and HTTP status conventions.</p>

                    <p>Service guarantees are defined exclusively by the Service SLA:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>concurrency rules, lifecycle correctness,</li>
                        <li>authorization boundaries,</li>
                        <li>and observable behavior under load and failure.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The Web Server does not define guarantees. It translates between HTTP and the service runtime. Any guarantee a client relies on must originate from the Service SLA and the service itself.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>Internal API Service Manager</h2>

                    <p>The Layer 8 Web Server includes an Internal API Service Manager responsible for bridging service contracts and web exposure.</p>

                    <p>Its role is simple and deliberate: to collect the Web API declarations defined in each Service SLA and wire them into the web server at runtime.</p>

                    <p>Services do not register endpoints manually. They publish their Web API declarations when activated.</p>

                    <p>Likewise, the web server does not assume services already exist. <strong>Discovery is symmetric and deterministic.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Web APIs are not configured. They are discovered.</strong></p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2>From Request to Service</h2>

                    <p>Request execution in Layer 8 is deliberately uneventful.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The Web Server validates identity through the Security Provider,</li>
                        <li>deserializes JSON into the declared input protobuf,</li>
                        <li>translates the HTTP method into a Layer 8 action,</li>
                        <li>and forwards the request to the target service.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The service executes under its SLA-defined rules.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The response is returned as Elements,</li>
                        <li>serialized into JSON,</li>
                        <li>and delivered to the caller.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Nothing in this flow is application-specific.</p>

                    <p><strong>Execution follows contracts. Transport remains an implementation detail.</strong></p>
